<h1 align=CENTER>Overview</h1>
<b>ncplot</b> is an interactive plotting tool for workstations running X11/R5,
Motif 1.2.  <b>ncplot</b> allows the user to view time-series data stored in
<a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/">netCDF</a>
files that conform to the
<a href="http://www.eol.ucar.edu/raf/Software/netCDF.html">NCAR-RAF/nimbus</a>

conventions.  Both Low-rate and Mixed-rate files are supported, as well as
files where the data have been reduced below 1 sps (sample per second), e.g.,
files run through <b>ncav</b>.
<p>
A few of its features are:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Plots up to 8 datasets per graph.
<li>Can draw from up to 4 netCDF files on the same plot.
<li>1 to 4 time-series strip charts.
<li>1 to 4 XY plots.
<li>XYZ plot.
<li>ASCII window.
<li>Spectra, Co-spectra, Quadrature, Coherence, and Phase.
<li>Allows user-defined titles, labels, scaling, and major &amp; minor tic marks.
<li>Annotations.
<li>Publication quality [Encapsulated] [color] PostScript printouts.
<li>Optional realtime/on-board mode.
</ul>
<b>ncplot</b> is NOT for contouring, image or vector data.
<p>
<b>ncplot</b> was written at the <a href="http://www.eol.ucar.edu/">Research
Aviation Facility</a> of <a href="http://www.ncar.ucar.edu/">The National
Center for Atmospheric Research</a> to view and analyze our aircraft data
(and NOAA's GIV).  The
<a href="http://www.eol.ucar.edu/raf/Software/netCDF.html">NCAR-RAF/nimbus</a>
conventions were designed to store multi-rate data, i.e., variable A may be
stored at 5sps and variable B at 25sps.  <b>ncplot</b> will plot variables of
differing rates (and from different files) next to each other.  Every effort
has been made to make it "what you see is what you get" between the screen
and printouts.

<h1 align=CENTER>Getting Started</h1>

<dl>
<dt><h3>Acquiring</h3></dt>
<dd><b>ncplot</b> is available at <a href="https://github.com/ncar/ncplot">https://github.com/ncar/ncplot</a>.</dd>

<dt><h3>Environment</h3></dt>
<dd><b>ncplot</b> is written in C, requiring X11/R6 and Motif 1.2 (or later),
and the <b>netCDF</b> library 3.0 or later.  Specifically it is developed
and maintained on Redhat Enterprise Linux 7.
<p>
<b>ncplot</b> uses, though it is not required, a shell environment variable
called <b>DATA_DIR</b> as the default directory to locate data files.
<p>
The Landmarks button on the track window looks in the directory defined by
the environment variable <b>PROJ_DIR</b> to locate <b>WINDS</b> landmarks
file.  If <b>PROJ_DIR</b> points to <b>/home/local/proj</b>, and you are
looking at data from ACE-1, (which is project number 130), then <b>ncplot</b>
will look for the file <b>/home/local/proj/130/landmarks</b>.  The project
number is stored in the header of the netCDF file and can be viewed from
the <b>netCDF Header</b> option under the <b>View</b> menu, or with the
netCDF utility program <b>ncdump</b>.
<p>
As of 2006 we have started to embed landmarks in the netCDF file as a global
attribute.</dd>

<dt><h3>Fonts</h3></dt>
<dd>Fonts can be over-ridden in the file <b>fbr.h</b>.
</dd>

<dt><h3>Command Line Options</h3></dt>
<dd>
<!-- Not supported.
<kbd class="att">-r</kbd> Run in realtime "onboard" mode.
-->
<p>
<kbd class="att">-t hh:mm:ss-hh:mm:ss</kbd>, allows time segment to be entered on command line.
<p>
<kbd class="att">-s template_file</kbd>, load a template file at startup.
<p>
<kbd class="att">data_file</kbd>, a netCDF data file that conforms to the
<a href="http://www.eol.ucar.edu/raf/Software/netCDF.html">NCAR-RAF/nimbus</a>
conventions.
</dd>

<dt><h3>Examples</h3></dt>
<dd>Run with no command line parameters:
<ul>
<pre class="CDL">1024% ncplot</pre>
</ul>
<p>
Load a single data file:
<ul>
<pre class="CDL">1025% ncplot /home/data/817rf15.cdf</pre>
</ul>
<p>

<h1 align=CENTER>Variable Selection Window</h1>

<img src="http://www.eol.ucar.edu/raf/Software/ctrl.png" align=right>

<dl>
<dt><h3>Moving around in Time</h3></dt>
<dd><b>ncplot</b> comes up with the first 30 minutes of the file as the starting
time frame.  New time frames may be entered in the <b>Time Period</b> area
at the top of the Variable Selection window, and then pressing <b>Apply</b>.
<p>
<b>PgFwd</b> and <b>PgBkd</b> buttons exist to facilitate moving through the
file in a sequential manner.  The <b>Page</b> buttons will keep the same
time frame length until End-of-File is reached; then the time frame may change
to whatever amount of time is remaining in the file.  Subsequent <b>PgBkd</b>
will maintain the new time frame length.
<p>
The time frame may also be changed in the <b>time-series</b> plots via the
<b>zoom</b> option.
<p>
If the flight wraps around midnight, times past midnight should be greater
than 24:00:00 (e.g. 1:00am start time should be entered as 25:00).

<dt><h3>Plot Type</h3></dt>
<dd>Three primary plot types are supported, <b>time-series</b>, <b>XY</b>, and
<b>XYZ</b>.  When you move from one plot type to another, your previous plot
is not lost.  To select a plot type, click on its button.
<p>
When you select <b>XY</b> or <b>XYZ</b> plot types, a window with additional
options pops up.
<p>
Keep in mind that, if you have all the plot types loaded with variables and
move around in time, ALL the variables will be reloaded from all the plots
(including wind vectors), and this may have a serious impact on execution
speed.

<dt><h3>Axes</h3></dt>
<dd>The various plot types have different active axes.  (Inactive axes
are in gray and cannot be selected.)
<p>
For the <b>time-series</b> plot, only the Y axis is valid, but you may
select whether future variables you select will be labeled on the right
or left side of the graph.
<p>
The <b>XY</b> plot has valid X and Y axes.  When the Y axis is selected,
you may choose left or right.  The <b>XY</b> plot maps each X with a Y
until one axis runs out of variables, then all remaining variables in
the longer list will be mapped to the last variable in the shorter list.
This allows for doing things like overlaying a GPS track plot on top of
a INS track plot without getting "cross-product" traces drawn.
<p>
The <b>XYZ</b> plot only supports one variable on each axis; therefore, there
is no "de-selecting" of variables; just select the new variables you want.

<dt><h3>Panels</h3></dt>
<dd>Panels are for <b>time-series</b> and <b>XY</b> plots.  This
allows you to have up to 4 strip-chart panels in one window for
<b>time-series</b> or 4 vertical profile style panels for <b>XY</b> plots.
Select which panel you want to add or delete variables from.  Use the
<b>Add</b> and <b>Delete</b> buttons to add and remove panels.  The
<b>Clear</b> button will remove all selected variables from the current panel.

<dt><h3>Selecting and Deselecting Variables</h3></dt>
<dd>After you have selected which data file, plot type, panel, axis
and location, just click on the variable you wish to <b>select</b>.
<p>
<dd>To <b>de-select</b> a variable, click on it again.  The file, axis, location and panel must all match from when the variable was selected.  This can get confusing if you are drawing data from multiple files.  When things get out of hand, you can can clear all variables from the current plot via the <b>Options</b> menu.
<p>
The <b>Variable Search</b> allows the user to quickly subset the visible list of variables based on the text typed into this box.

<dt><h3>Options</h3></dt>
<dd>
 <dl><dt><b>Black &amp; White (on/off)</b></dt>
 <dd>Converts all color traces to black and white.  Dashed lines are used
to differentiate variables in black and white.  This option is provided
to let the user preview monochrome printing.
<p>
 <dt><b>UT seconds (on/off)</b></dt>
 <dd>Changes time format to seconds since midnight on <b>time-series</b> plots
only.
<p>
 <dt><b>Grid (on/off)</b></dt>
 <dd>Turns grid on or off for <b>time-series, XY, and XYZ</b> plots.
<p>
 <dt><b>Tracking (on/off)</b></dt>
 <dd>Provides cross-hair target across all plots, displaying engineering values
of the center of the cross hair.
<p>
 <dt><b>Line thickness</b></dt>
 <dd>Let's you select how thick the data traces will be.
 </dl>

<dt><h3>XY and XYZ additional options (separate window)</h3></dt>


<dd>Much of this window is oriented toward flight track plots.  This window
is only effective for <b>XY</b> and <b>XYZ</b> plots.
<p>
<img src="http://www.eol.ucar.edu/raf/Software/xy.png" align=center>
 <dl>
 <dt><h4>Flight Tracks</h4></dt>
  <ul>
  <li>The <b>INS Track</b> and <b>GPS Track</b> buttons are convienence
functions to quickly load the variables from the respective instruments.  In
the case of the <b>XYZ</b> plot, Pressure Altitude is loaded.  The variable
names used are currently hard-coded into the software (LAT, LON, [PALT], and
GLAT, GLON, [GALT]).  <b>ncplot</b> will load as many of the variables as
it can find (e.g.  GALT is routinely not output, and therefore nothing will
be loaded for the Z axis in the <b>XYZ</b> plot when <b>GPS Track</b> is
pressed).
<p>
  <li>The <b>Landmarks</b> file is the same one used by <b>WINDS</b>
(see the <b>Environment</b> section for details on location).  Below is
the file from <b>ACE-1</b>:

<div class="example">
<pre class="CDL">
-42.83 147.52 Hobart 1
-43.05 147.08 Huonville 1
-43.64 146.82 SEcape 1
-43.57 146.04 SWcape 1
-42.157 145.80 Strahan 1
</pre>
</div>

The trailing value of zero or one is not used by <b>ncplot</b>, but is
relevant to <b>WINDS</b>.
<p>
  <li>The <b>geo-political map</b> makes use of the GMT coastline and
geo-political maps.  See appendix on GMT Installation.
<p>
  <li><b>Track scaling</b> is a convenience button to over-ride autoscaling and "square up" the track plot.  Degrees lat and lon are converted to a distance based on median lat, and then equal delta X and delta Y are computed.
  </ul>
 <dt><h4>Wind vectors</h4></dt>
 <dd><b>Wind vectors</b> may be added to the <b>XY</b> plot only. (We decided
it would look too confusing on the <b>XYZ</b> plot.)  Select whether you
would like <b>averaged</b> or <b>instantaneous</b> vectors, and the
<b>interval</b> in seconds that you would like them displayed.  You may
also change the variables you wish to be used.  If wind vectors are already
turned on when you change the variables, you must turn them off and then
back on to reload the new variables.
<p>

 <dt><h4>Miscellaneous options</h4></dt>
 <dd>
  <dl>
  <dt><b>Direction arrows</b></dt>
  <dd>Enter the number of direction arrows desired in the text box.
<p>
  <dt><b>Time stamps</b></dt>
  <dd>Enter the number of time-stamps desired in the text box.
<p>
  <dt><b>Scatter plot</b></dt>
  <dd>Changes line segments to dots, for <b>XY</b> only.
<p>
  <dt><b>Project to XY-plane</b></dt>
  <dd>Projects a trace of the XYZ plot onto the XY plane.
<p>
  <dt><b>Project to back plane</b></dt>
  <dd>Projects a trace of the XYZ plot onto the back and side planes.

<h1 align=CENTER>Canvas Features</h1>
<dl>
<dt><b>Annotate</b></dt>
<dd><b>ncplot</b> has the ability to <b>annotate</b> graphs.  In the upper
right corner of the main <b>plot canvas</b> there are a couple of buttons,
one with the letter "<b>A</b>".  Press the "<b>A</b>", and your pointer
will turn into a text insertion style cursor.  Move the cursor to where
you would like to start the annotation, and press the left mouse button.
Start typing, and finish the annotation by pressing <b>return</b>.  Doing
just about anything will clear all annotations (due to the difficulty of
tracking their location as the user moves around in time, and rescales axes).
They should be added as the final option before printing.</dd>
<p>
<dt><b>Resize</b></dt>
<dd>All plot canvas windows are fully <b>resizable</b>.  In the case of the
<b>spectral</b> window, some buttons will get clipped off the screen.
Resizing the screen will have <b>no</b> affect on sizing or proportion
of your printout, this is controlled via the <b>Printer Setup</b> option.</dd>
<p>
<dt><b>Zoom</b></dt>
<dd>A <b>zoom</b> feature exists; place the mouse in the upper left corner
of what you want to zoom in on, hold the left mouse button down, and drag the
box over the segment you want to see.  Moving left or above the initial
point will cancel the zoom when you let go.  Your mileage may vary if
autoscaling is turned on.  There is a un-zoom located in the
Options menu.</dd>
<p>
<dt><b>Menu accelerators</b></dt>
<dd>When looking through the various menus, one will notice <b>CTRL</b>
sequences to the right of the menu option label.  These are called
<b>menu accelerators</b>, in <b>ncplot</b> they only work while the
cursor is located in the <b>plot canvas</b>.</dd>
</dl>

<a name="pc2"></a>
<hr>
<h1 align=CENTER>Guide to Menus</h1>
<dl>
<dt><h3>File Menu</h3></dt>
<dd>The items in the File menu allow opening of data files from disk,
printer setup, and printing.  In the case of an operation that will
overwrite an existing file, you will be prompted by an alert that allows
you to abort the write if you don't want the file to be overwritten.
<p>
 <dl>
 <dt><b>Open Data File</b>.</dt>
 <dd>This displays a File Selection Box to select a file to read.  There
is no error checking to see if the input file is valid.  Invalid files
tend to cause a segmentation fault.  Open Data File will close out all
previously-opened files.</dd>
<p>
 <dt><b>Add Data File</b>.</dt>
 <dd>This displays a File Selection Box to select an additional file to open.</dd>
<p>
 <dt><b>Save Template</b>.</dt>
 <dd>Save current plot to disk file for future retrieval.  Note, file names and
time slices are not saved, this just saves the plot type, number of panels,
the current variables, and User Calculations.</dd>
<p>
 <dt><b>Load Template</b>.</dt>
 <dd>Load a previously saved template.  This will clear the current plot that
matches the plot type in the template file.  You must already have a file</dd>
open.
<p>
 <dt><b>Save PostScript</b>.</dt>
 <dd>This displays a File Selection Box prompting for the name of the file
where you want to write the PostScript output.</dd>
<p>
 <dt><b>Printer Setup</b>.</dt>
 <dd>This pops up a window with options to change the 'lp' command, the size of
plot to be printed, whether to print landscape or portrait, and color vs.
black and white.</dd>
<p>
 <dt><b>Print</b>.</dt>
 <dd>This opens a pipe and sends PostScript commands to <b>lp(1)</b>.</dd>
<p>
 <dt><b>Save <a href="http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/">PNG</a></b>.</dt>
 <dd>This option allows you to save the plot image as a graphics file, which
can then be used in web pages, etc.  You can adjust the size of the image
saved by first sizing the plot canvas.</dd>
<p>
 </dl></dd>

<dt><h3>Edit Menu</h3></dt>
<dd>The <b>Edit Parameter</b> windows allow the user to edit titles, labels,
autoscaling, number of tic marks, log vs. linear, and scale inversion for
each of the plots or windows.
<p>
<img src="http://www.eol.ucar.edu/raf/Software/eparm.png">

 <dd>
 <dl>
 <dt><b>ASCII</b>.</dt>
 <dd>This opens a window for viewing the data in ASCII format.  Some options
pertaining to this are available in the 'Edit Plot Parameters' menu item.
Note: Because it is possible so many points may be displayed on the graphs
the ASCII window only displays the first 300 (by default) points.  Furthermore,
only the first 60 points are printed.  However, the save button pops up a
file selection window allowing you to save the entire time segment to a file
of your choice.  If the <b>Spectral</b> window is open, then the ASCII window
will display the frequency domain output.</dd>

<h1 align=CENTER>Spectral Window</h1>
<a name="sw1"></a>
<h3>Features</h3>
A spectrum is computed from the first variable in the <b>time-series</b>
window, using the same time segment.  Co-spectra, quadrature, coherence, and
phase are computed from the first two variables being displayed in the
<b>time-series</b> window.
<p>
Along the top row are three buttons, <b>Dismiss</b> and <b>Print</b> should
be obvious.  Sizing, <b>lp</b> command, and orientation from the <b>Printer
Setup</b> window will be effective.  The <b>Edit Parms</b> button is a
convenient short cut to the <b>Edit</b> menu item of the same name.
<p>
The first group of "radio buttons" in the upper right corner are also
short cuts to the items listed under the <b>View</b> menu of the same
name, which allow you to conveniently toggle between the various spectral
displays.
<p>
The next group, consists of three "option menus", and a recompute button.
These items control some of the power spectrum density computations.
The first menu is the <b>Segment length</b> to be used by the FFT, and
indirectly determines how many segments will be averaged together.  The
second menu is the <b>Windowing</b> function to be applied to each segment.
The third menu determines what type of <b>Detrending</b> to apply to the
entire time-series data.  (It is not applied to each segment.)  See <b>How
is my spectrum being computed</b>, below, for more details.  You must press the
<b>Recompute</b> button to have the changes in any of these menus take affect.
<p>
You will notice that two <b>variances</b> are shown at the bottom of the
display.  <b>Total variance</b> is always displayed, and the sum includes
the 0th point or DC component of the Pxx spectrum array.  The second
variance listed is the <b>Band Limited Variance</b>.  By default this
is just the total variance minus the DC component.  However you may change
the <b>Start frequency</b> or <b>End frequency</b> to get the <b>variance</b>
computed over a specified interval.  The <b>Start/End frequencies</b> will
be truncated down to the nearest bin, no partitioning of these bins will occur.
<p>
<b>Time-shifting</b> for <b>co-spectrum</b> is supported.  While you
may enter a value to the nearest millisecond, the data will only be
shifted to the nearest sample.  For example, if you are doing spectra
on 25sps data, the gap between samples is 40 milliseconds, anything less
than 40 milliseconds that you enter will be truncated to 0, and anything
between 40 and 79 will be truncated to 40 milliseconds or 1 sample.
<p>
<b>Equal-log interval averaging</b> may be turned on to reduce the noise
being displayed.  You may choose how many points to display, however some
number less than that will actually be displayed due to some bins having
no values to average in.

<h3>Plot Options</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Grid</b> - applies a grid to the plot.<br>
<li><b>Multiply output by frequency</b> - does just that; only works for
<b>spectrum</b> as it is the default for <b>co-spectrum</b>.<br>
<li><b>Wave length scale</b> - may be added to the <b>top</b> of the plot
 (TASX required).<br>
<li><b>Wave number scale</b> - can replace the <b>bottom</b> frequency scale
 (TASX required).<br>
</ul>

<h3>How is my spectrum being computed?</h3>
<menu>
<menu>
  M     = segment length divided by 2.
<br>
  K     = number of segments (nPoints / M) + 2.
<br>
  Pxx   = Output spectral array (length = M).
<br>
  Wss   = Window summed and squared.
<br>
  nPoints = Number of points in time series.
</menu>
Defaults:
<menu>
  Detrend = Linear regression.
<br>
  Segment Length = 1024 (M = 512).
<br>
  Window = Parzen.
</menu>
</menu>
<p>
The entire time series data shown in the main ncplot window is
detrended with the user-selected detrend function, and padded
with zeroes on each end, to bring the data length up to a 2 to
the N power. (The FFT algorithm used requires this.)  K is incremented
by 2 to make sure every real point is used twice.
<p>
The detrended data are then scaled by two different factors, one to
compensate for the effect of zero padding, and the other to compensate
for the effect of windowing.
<p>
The Welch peridiogram is then applied.  Data segments (of length 2M)
are window'ed, FFT'ed, and summed into Pxx.  Each segment overlaps
the previous segment by 50%.  Parzen, Welch, and Hanning are among
the best windows to choose from.
<p>
Pxx is averaged by dividing by K * Wss * 2M.

<h1 align=center>Configuration File</h1>
<b>ncplot</b> will read a file titled <b>.ncplotrc</b> in your home directory,
if it exists.  The following options may be overridden:<p>
<kbd class="att">Colors = </kbd>a list of seven colors space and/or comma seperated.<br>
<kbd class="att">PrintCommand = </kbd>new print command (eg: lp -d color -o nobanner).<br>
<kbd class="att">PrintColor = </kbd>Color (default is B&amp;W).<br>
<kbd class="att">LineWidth = </kbd># (default is 1).<br>
<kbd class="att">TemplateDirectory = </kbd>Directory path<br>
<kbd class="att">TrueAirspeed = </kbd>TAS variable name (default is TASX).<br>
<kbd class="att">GpsLongitude = </kbd>GPS LON variable name (default is GLON).<br>

<h1>GMT Geo-Political Map Installation</h1>

The geo-political map makes use of the
<a href="http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu">GMT</a> <b>pscoast</b> sub-command.
<p>
For GMT installation from source the <b>GMTHOME</b> environment variable must
be defined for <b>ncplot</b> to engage mapping.  The <b>gmt</b> command
must be in your <b>$GMTHOME/bin</b>, and the coast libraries
<b>$GMTHOME/lib/binned_*.cdf</b> (~75Mb) must be installed.
<p>
Pre-canned packages exist for Ubuntu/Debian, RHEL/CentOS, MacOSX, and Windows.  Please
visit the GMT installation page at <a href="http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/projects/gmt/wiki/Installing">http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/projects/gmt/wiki/Installing</a>.
<p>
For RHEL/CentOS installs, the gmt-gshhg package is missing the high-resolution netCDF files,
so I <a href="http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/projects/gmt/wiki/Download">downloaded</a> those
my self and copied the files into /usr/share/gshhg-gmt-nc4.

<h1>Known Problems</h1>
<ul>
<li>If the menu and button text shows up as squares, then some fonts are missing.
'yum install "xorg-x11-fonts-ISO8859-1*"' should solve the problem.
<li>Time gaps in the netCDF file.  Time gaps should be filled with _FillValue or
missing_value.  ncplot uses the TimeInterval global attribute to determine how many
records are in the file.
<li>Invalid data files may cause a core dump.
<li>No minor tic marks exist for Y axis on XYZ plot.
</ul>

Building and installing ncplot (Linux/MacOS).

1) Redhat dependencies
   - 'dnf install flex-devel netcdf-devel motif-devel gsl-devel'

2) Edit Makefile to fit your needs.
   - Default is Linux, see section for MacOS.
   - Check for any OS depencies, but most have been removed.
   - Uncomment UBUNTU if that is what you are building on.

3) Type 'make'

4) If you're installing for a system, put binary in appropriate place
   (e.g.  /usr/local/bin).  If you are a lone user, put the binary wherever
   you want (e.g. $HOME/bin).

   'make install' will default to /usr/local/bin

5) You may need to do: dnf install "xorg-x11-fonts-ISO*"



Mac OSX using Homebrew (ncplot is availble from macports as of 2021).

You need three things:

1) Xcode command line tools or Xcode from Apple App Store.  Don't forget to run
   Xcode after it is installed to accept license, and/or "xcode-select --install"
   for the command line tools.

   xcode-select --install

2) Using Homebrew instead of MacPorts.  https://brew.sh/
   Run "brew bundle" in this directory after initial homebrew install to fetch
   dependencies.

   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   cd ncplot
   brew bundle
   make
   brew install whatever else the bundle missed.

3) XQuartz download for X11, it is no longer bundled with MacOS.  This is
   required to display X11 GUI programs.

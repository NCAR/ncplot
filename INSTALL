Building and installing ncplot (Solaris/Linux).

1) Edit Makefile to fit your needs.
    - You need to define ${LOCAL}.
    - Uncomment/comment section for your OS.
    - ${INCLUDES} only needs to locate "netcdf.h" & X11/Xm .h files.
    - If you want to use the "install" target, delete superfluous 'cp's.

2) Type 'make'

3) If you're installing for a system, put binary in appropriate place
   (e.g.  /usr/local/bin).

   If you are a lone user, put the binary wherever you want (e.g. $HOME/bin).

4) Make sure all previous XmNCplot resource files have been deleted.  You
   may create a resource file for over-riding fonts, colors, etc.

Building and installing ncplot (Linux/MacOS).

1) Edit Makefile to fit your needs.
    - You need to define ${JLOCAL} for binary install location.
    - Uncomment/comment section for your OS.  Default is Linux, see section for MacOS.

2) Type 'make'

3) If you're installing for a system, put binary in appropriate place
   (e.g.  /usr/local/bin).

   If you are a lone user, put the binary wherever you want (e.g. $HOME/bin).

4) You may need to do: yum install "xorg-x11-fonst-ISO*"
